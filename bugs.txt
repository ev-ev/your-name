Bugs
[??] After pasting in content, LLCHAR_countLinesTill returns less than actual value, resulting in scroll bar issue
    Can be resolved by typing in a character then backspacing
    Pointer cur of both situations are same, yet countLinesTill returns same value
    why?
    I realized why, its because it hasnt been updated with wrapped chars
[*] Max chars on line then newline empty line
