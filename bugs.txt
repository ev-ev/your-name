Bugs
[-] Max chars on line then newline empty line
[-] When resizing and scrollbar needs to be moved may flicker a bit
[!] Program crashed at some point during testing on call to free(). Somewhere memory is being corrupted, to resolve this I have written some modules to send alerts when buffer is overrun somewhere. Hopefully this can be traced down and found.

Selected Target (if any)

Targets

RESOLVED [?] = fixed by itself
[+] Visual bug when scrolling on lagframes (probably because ScrollWindow does not target the buffer and instead targets the window directly) 
[+] Out of view cursor renders on menubar
[+] If scrolled with cursor at position 0, the cursor scrolls with the camera (visual bug)
[+] After resizing need to scroll to return camera to proper position
[+] When pressing Ctrl+backspace it makes weird input
