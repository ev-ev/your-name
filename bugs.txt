Bugs
[-] Max chars on line then newline empty line
[-] After resizing need to scroll to return camera to proper position
[!] If scrolled with cursor at position 0, the cursor scrolls with the camera (visual bug)
[-] When pressing Ctrl+backspace it makes weird input
[-] Visual bug when scrolling on lagframes (probably because ScrollWindow does not target the buffer and instead targets the window directly) 
[-] Out of view cursor renders on menubar
